-- CORE PRINCIPLE (M2, 2026-09-25 — read before extending this mod):
-- SmartAI does not create the battlefield situation it reacts to.
-- It exploits the battlefield situation created by the existing game AI.
--
-- Consequences for every future check:
--   * No production/spawns (AI.QueueUnit is BLOCKED live; zero SpawnUnit
--     in this file — verified by grep). We command existing units only.
--   * No order lease (vanilla re-selects eventually). We issue transition-
--     only orders + cooldowns and measure persistence via readback, never
--     assume it. Fighting units are NEVER yanked.
--   * Vanilla owns the mass (attack waves, demo-truck teams, base building).
--     SmartAI owns the point decisions on top: which economy to snipe,
--     when to retreat, whom to escort, when to stand down the base.
--   * A layer that needs vanilla to leave units idle will starve live
--     (proven 2026-09-25: idle pool=0 all match) — always add the
--     marching-not-fighting second choice.
--   * Surrender is a conjunction (no Barracks AND no WF AND no MCV/CY),
--     never a single-building trigger; anchor tables err toward DELAYING.


-- Difficulty: "auto" | "easy" | "medium" | "hard" (default "auto").
-- "auto" (2026-09-25, per-house): each AI house gets the preset matching
-- its lobby AI difficulty via house:GetAIDifficulty() (LuaAPI Beta M1,
-- normalized "easy"|"normal"|"hard"; engine stores it reversed). "normal"
-- maps to the medium preset. Old DLL (binding absent -> nil) or any
-- unexpected value falls back to SmartAI.DIFFICULTY_FALLBACK for that
-- house. A fixed value ("easy"/"medium"/"hard") still applies to every
-- AI house and remains the test override.
-- Design note (unchanged): presets scale OBSERVATION and TEMPO only —
-- scan cadence, radii, defender counts, cooldowns. No preset grants
-- production, credits, spawn or any economy cheat: the intelligence split
-- is behavioral (easy = rally only; medium = full behavior; hard = same
-- brain, faster reactions), never economic.

-- Engine defeat transition on surrender: OFF (2026-09-26).
--
-- When true, a house that satisfies the surrender DoD is additionally passed
-- to Engine.__SmartAILose -> HouseClass::Lose(false), which forces the
-- engine's internal defeat transition. Measured consequence in a 1-human +
-- 3-AI match: the engine leaves the game main loop ~90 frames later, at
-- BorrowedTime expiry, and the whole match ends and the process exits
-- (code 0) with every other house still alive and undefeated. Reproduced
-- 3/3. Control-flow counters prove Lose() returns and the detour is merely
-- never entered again.
--
-- False keeps surrender as a DECISION only: the latch, order silence, base
-- liquidation and the HUD notice. Defeat itself stays the engine's job, which
-- is what this mod's architecture says it should be. Flip to true only to
-- reproduce the old behaviour for diagnosis.

-- future divergence between mirror and detector fails a test instead of
-- silently producing wrong diagnostics.
